Don't try to smuggle a phone or any other piece of technology over the wall that marks the Border - unless you enjoy a fireworks display in your backpack. (Ballpoint pens are okay.) There are elves, harpies, and - best of all as far as Elliot is concerned - mermaids.&nbsp;</p> <p>Elliot? Who's Elliot? Elliot is 13 years old. He's smart and just a tiny bit obnoxious. Sometimes more than a tiny bit. When his class goes on a field trip and he can see a wall that no one else can see, he is given the chance to go to school in the Borderlands. It turns out that on the other side of the wall, classes involve a lot more weaponry and fitness training and fewer mermaids than he expected.&nbsp;</p> <p>On the other hand, there's Serene-Heart-in-the-Chaos-of-Battle, an elven warrior who is more beautiful than anyone Elliot has ever seen, and then there's her human friend Luke: sunny, blond, and annoyingly likeable. There are lots of interesting books. There's even the chance Elliot might be able to change the world.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>In Other Lands</i> is the exhilarating new book from beloved and best-selling author Sarah Rees Brennan. It's a novel about surviving four years in the most unusual of schools, about friendship, falling in love, diplomacy, and finding your own place in the world - even if it means giving up your phone.</p>","releaseDate":"2018-04-03","publishers":[{"name":"Tantor Audio"}],"length":"17h 19m ","categories":[{"name":"Teen","url":"18580715011"},{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18580894011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tant/010744/bk_tant_010744_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"515o-Je9gLL","asin":"B08NC8FBF2","subHeading":"Fae Out of Water, Book One","title":"Cutie and the Beast","authors":"E.J.

His career is filled with so many “<i>he was there</i>” moments it’s a wonder he doesn’t recall them with the swagger of a conquering hero: songwriting and singing as a teenager in Detroit; co-founding Motown Records with Berry Gordy; creating 26 Top 40 hits with his group The Miracles; helping to spark racial integration of popular music in the 1960s; discovering hitmakers like Diana Ross and the Supremes; penning tunes for a jaw-droppingly diverse group of artists including Marvin Gaye, The Beatles, The Jackson Five, Kim Carnes, Linda Ronstadt; and releasing smash hits as solo artist well into the 1980s.</p> <p>But surprisingly, and delightfully, Robinson is as awed by his success as we are listening to him describe it. He guides us through his extraordinary career with the same giddy sense of discovery and delight that music fans recall the first time they heard one of his infectious tunes.</p> <p>He takes us back to his group’s first, disastrous performance at the Apollo Theater, opening for a brilliant and generous Ray Charles. He describes daily life at the famed Hitsville studio in Detroit, where a young Diana Ross or Martha Reeves could be found working as the receptionist. He shares his pride in being an influence on the Beatles and hearing his songs on their album - a transforming moment for the Motown sound. “I ain't never heard no popular white boys say anything like that ever. For them to come out and tell the world? They were my guys from then on.”</p> <p>And, of course, he takes us inside his songs. He describes where he was - shaving in the mirror at home - when “The Tracks of My Tears” finally came together. He remembers taking the wheel on the last 150 miles back to Detroit after a tour, humming the melody that would become the Temptations hit “The Way You Do the Things You Do.” He recalls being floored by the way a 10-year-old Michael Jackson brought a depth and soul to “Who’s Loving You.” And he explains where the term “Quiet Storm” originated, a song title that went on to become an entire musical genre.</p> <p>It’s a journey Robinson revisits with a grateful, humble heart. He has no agenda to push, no axes to grind, no scores to settle. He reflects on the ups as well as downs, and looks back with appreciation for the people who put love in his life. That makes listening a distinct pleasure: You get to spend time with a hugely influential artist who is warm, upbeat, and proud to have built a life and career through his art.</p>","releaseDate":"2020-11-19","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Originals"}],"length":"1h 35m ","categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"Entertainment & Celebrities","url":"18571984011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/001276/or_orig_001276_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Performance","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61jCQyokCqL","asin":"B08S5B25Y3","title":"Dispossession","authors":"Tayari Jones","narrators":"Gabrielle Union","length":"57 mins"},{"cover":"51PsnheQZ6L","asin":"B08KWNTR1M","title":"Alanis Morissette: Words + Music","authors":"Alanis Morissette","narrators":"Alanis Morissette","length":"1 hr and 31 mins"},{"cover":"51WV-3F8XiL","asin":"B08M93Q9SP","subHeading":"Montreal to New York","title":"Road Trip Elegies","authors":"Rufus Wainwright","narrators":"Rufus Wainwright","length":"3 hrs and 29 mins"},{"cover":"51Qs2dPG6XL","asin":"1735803200","title":"Fauci","authors":"Michael Specter","narrators":"Michael Specter","length":"3 hrs"},{"cover":"513y43PKExL","asin":"B08NWBF1Z3","subHeading":"My Life with Beethoven","title":"Unquiet","authors":"Jonathan Biss","narrators":"Jonathan Biss","length":"1 hr and 46 mins"},{"cover":"51AY3hc8xqL","asin":"B08HNJ2CZG","title":"Sheryl Crow: Words + Music","authors":"Sheryl Crow","narrators":"Sheryl Crow","length":"1 hr and 37 mins"},{"cover":"41rrK3zzDiL","asin":"0062931350","subHeading":"A Memoir","title":"Just as I Am","authors":"Cicely Tyson, Michelle Burford","narrators":"Cicely Tyson, Viola Davis, Robin Miles","length":"16 hrs and 9 mins"},{"cover":"51lctAfvrcL","asin":"B08C36PKWN","title":"Half Light","authors":"Tayari Jones","narrators":"Bahni Turpin","length":"1 hr and 20 mins"},{"cover":"611ulIElcsL","asin":"1541437586","subHeading":"Revised and Updated","title":"Temptations","authors":"Otis Williams, Patricia Romanowski - with","narrators":"JD Jackson, Otis Williams","length":"9 hrs and 21 mins"},{"cover":"41bffUhJ4xL","asin":"0525633723","title":"A Promised Land","authors":"Barack Obama","narrators":"Barack Obama","length":"29 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"51W3tzUXA5L","asin":"B08P5F32XM","title":"People in Hell Want Ice Water","authors":"Edan Lepucki","narrators":"Dan Bittner","length":"1 hr and 21 mins"},{"cover":"51BGPJCkfsL","asin":"B08G1Z4ZJF","title":"St. Vincent: Words + Music","authors":"St. Vincent","narrators":"St. Vincent","length":"1 hr and 29 mins"},{"cover":"51ubEtGvm1L","asin":"B08DVCMY4Y","subHeading":"Speaking Truth to Power Through Stories and Song","title":"Tom Morello at Minetta Lane Theatre","authors":"Tom Morello","narrators":"Tom Morello","length":"1 hr and 42 mins"},{"cover":"612I4xe0IhL","asin":"B08BW1VY1X","title":"The Meaning of Mariah Carey","authors":"Mariah Carey","narrators":"Mariah Carey","length":"11 hrs and 17 mins"},{"cover":"51sgX-132lL","asin":"1250808421","subHeading":"Reckoning with Race in America","title":"Long Time Coming","authors":"Michael Eric Dyson","narrators":"Michael Eric Dyson","length":"4 hrs and 46 mins"},{"cover":"51h8RjYuMSL","asin":"B07YVLF72T","subHeading":"Romey University, Book 1","title":"Teach Me","authors":"Alexandria House","narrators":"Jakobi Diem, Adenrele Ojo","length":"9 hrs and 51 mins"},{"cover":"51UG6U-EjgL","asin":"B08PG5JBN5","title":"History of Wine in 10 Glasses","authors":"Paul Wagner","narrators":"Paul Wagner","length":"3 hrs and 50 mins"},{"cover":"51AsUIfn4xL","asin":"B08BTYG121","title":"Yard Work","authors":"David Koepp","narrators":"Kevin Bacon","length":"1 hr and 54 mins"}],"added":248},{"asin":"0593396960","cover":"516MN+bKViL","title":"Ready Player Two: A Novel","authors":[{"name":"Ernest Cline","url":"B004XRR8Z6"}],"narrators":[{"name":"Wil Wheaton"}],"series":[{"name":"Ready Player One","asin":"B08CM7ZZ11","bookNumbers":["2"]}],"blurb":"The highly anticipated sequel to the beloved worldwide best seller Ready Player One, the near-future adventure that inspired the blockbuster Steven Spielberg film....","downloaded":true,"progress":"58m left","titleShort":"Ready Player Two","ratings":34593,"rating":4.3,"summary":"<p><b>The highly anticipated sequel to the beloved worldwide best seller </b><b><i>Ready Player One</i></b><b>, the near-future adventure that inspired the blockbuster Steven Spielberg film. </b></p> <p><b>An unexpected quest.

Yet when Richard has a problem, he turns to his valet, a fixer of unparalleled genius - and the object of Richard's deepest desires.

But when David is close enough to touch, the rules of class collide with the basest sort of animal instinct: overpowering lust. </p> <p>For David Cyprian, burglary and blackmail are as much in a day's work as bootblacking - anything for the man he's devoted to.

Until Dreadnought fell out of the sky and died right in front of her, Danny was trying to keep people from finding out she's transgender. But before he expired, Dreadnought passed his mantle to her, and those secondhand superpowers transformed Danny's body into what she's always thought it should be. Now there's no hiding that she's a girl. </p> <p>It should be the happiest time of her life, but Danny's first weeks finally living in a body that fits her are more difficult and complicated than she could have imagined. Between her father's dangerous obsession with \"curing\" her girlhood, her best friend suddenly acting like he's entitled to date her, and her fellow superheroes arguing over her place in their ranks, Danny feels like she's in over her head. </p> <p>She doesn't have time to adjust. Dreadnought's murderer - a cyborg named Utopia - still haunts the streets of New Port City, threatening destruction. If Danny can't sort through the confusion of coming out, master her powers, and stop Utopia in time, humanity faces extinction. </p> <p>Original cover art copyright Diversion Publishing Corp. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-05-24","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"categories":[{"name":"Children's Audiobooks","url":"18572091011"},{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18572586011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/030612/bk_adbl_030612_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51iKLWA424L","asin":"B0735XJGL4","title":"Sovereign","authors":"April Daniels","narrators":"Natasha Soudek","length":"12 hrs and 59 mins"},{"cover":"51ITVPAMetL","asin":"B078NZ2Q4H","title":"The Armored Saint","authors":"Myke Cole","narrators":"Michi Barall","length":"7 hrs and 14 mins"},{"cover":"61VOsUD32GL","asin":"B075QNDHWY","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Philosopher's Flight","authors":"Tom Miller","narrators":"Gibson Frazier","length":"13 hrs and 37 mins"},{"cover":"51WioBf500L","asin":"1978623380","subHeading":"The Golden Arrow Mysteries Series, Book 1","title":"The Frame-Up","authors":"Meghan Scott Molin","narrators":"Andrea Emmes","length":"10 hrs and 18 mins"},{"cover":"41SyY+o9fkL","asin":"B07L74Z2QH","title":"Shadow Beast","authors":"Luke Phillips","narrators":"Andrew Pond","length":"9 hrs"},{"cover":"61CQKYWMSaL","asin":"B07GJ5W4BG","title":"You're Going to Mars!","authors":"Rob Dircks","narrators":"Khristine Hvam","length":"11 hrs and 12 mins"},{"cover":"61Mp2ukyMHL","asin":"B00AFZO9PM","title":"Rip-Off!","authors":"John Scalzi, Jack Campbell, Mike Resnick, and others","narrators":"Wil Wheaton, Scott Brick, Christian Rummel, and others","length":"11 hrs and 58 mins"},{"cover":"51W1Ka05WML","asin":"B078JXCH4G","title":"Eternal Life","authors":"Dara Horn","narrators":"Elisabeth Rodgers","length":"8 hrs and 54 mins"},{"cover":"514eu6PLx5L","asin":"B07MP7P6G5","subHeading":"Red Mage, Book 1","title":"Advent","authors":"Xander Boyce","narrators":"Luke Daniels","length":"10 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"51+mpeJfU6L","asin":"B002UZNIHK","title":"METAtropolis","authors":"Jay Lake, Tobias Buckell, Elizabeth Bear, and others","narrators":"Michael Hogan, Scott Brick, Kandyse McClure, and others","length":"9 hrs and 7 mins"},{"cover":"51B-1FE9J6L","asin":"B07MQBFCXL","title":"The Worldship Humility","authors":"R.

This is an easy \"Yes\". Eliza has always preferred Nana Mora's beach cottage on St. Simons Island to the apartment she and her mom call home in the city. The island is a magical place where stories and legends grow as thick as the Spanish moss dangling in the trees. Now, Nana Mora's eyesight is fading, and there's something she wants to show Eliza before it’s totally gone: a mythical place locals refer to as Sirens Harbor. Supposedly hidden somewhere on the island, it's a place where all the mermaids in the world congregate once a year to sing their Winter Song. It's all fairy-tale silliness, according to Eliza's mom. But Nana Mora is convinced it's real.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>With the help of an eccentric lighthouse keeper, Nana and Eliza pack up their gear and set out on their journey. As they travel, Eliza hears the real story of Sirens Harbor...along with the story of a fearsome mermaid named Silverswift, a warrior-princess rumored to have walked on the islands. Challenges abound for the adventurers: old maps are hard to read, and treacherous trails spiral through the woods. And there's a strange storm spinning all around them. It's almost as if some things are meant to stay secret. As if the harbor doesn't want to be found. Or as if, maybe, someone doesn't want them to find it....&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>One thing is for sure: what Eliza and her grandmother actually discover on the night of the winter solstice will be better than any fairytale.

And while it hasn't landed me a job, or a husband, it has convinced Her Majesty the Queen and the Dowager Duchess to enlist my help. I have been entrusted with grooming Jack Altringham - the Duke's newly discovered heir fresh from the Outback of Australia - for high society. The upside is I am to live in luxury at one of England's most gorgeous stately homes. But upon arrival at Kingsdowne Place, my dearest Darcy has been sent to fetch Jack, leaving me stuck in a manor full of miscreants…none of whom are too pleased with the discovery of my new ward. And no sooner has the lad been retrieved than the Duke announces he wants to choose his own heir. With the house in a hubbub over the news, Jack's hunting knife somehow finds its way into the Duke's back. Eyes fall, backs turn, and fingers point to the young heir. As if the rascal wasn't enough of a handful, now he's suspected of murder. Jack may be wild, but I'd bet the crown jewels it wasn't he who killed the Duke….\"</p>","releaseDate":"2013-08-06","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"length":"8h 22m ","categories":[{"name":"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574597011"},{"name":"Mystery","url":"18574606011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/013539/bk_adbl_013539_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51VqbeMbLaL","asin":"B00M4MTZS0","title":"Queen of Hearts","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Katherine Kellgren","length":"10 hrs and 6 mins"},{"cover":"51R7BAiH-iL","asin":"B0118MSI3Y","title":"Malice at the Palace","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Katherine Kellgren","length":"9 hrs and 48 mins"},{"cover":"51Uji+7CYOL","asin":"B01HDTEWSG","title":"Crowned and Dangerous","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Katherine Kellgren","length":"9 hrs and 57 mins"},{"cover":"617IJEFYHfL","asin":"B0744X249W","subHeading":"A Royal Spyness Mystery, Book 11","title":"On Her Majesty's Frightfully Secret Service","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Katherine Kellgren","length":"9 hrs and 57 mins"},{"cover":"51V8+fOGvVL","asin":"B07FPQ2L4P","title":"Four Funerals and Maybe a Wedding","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Jasmine Blackborow","length":"9 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"51EpH6SLTWL","asin":"B084T5J52D","subHeading":"Royal Spyness, Book 14","title":"The Last Mrs. Summers","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Jasmine Blackborow","length":"9 hrs and 57 mins"},{"cover":"51l3nInaLUL","asin":"B00GR98DAM","title":"Murphy's Law","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Nicola Barber","length":"7 hrs and 32 mins"},{"cover":"51hvar2DMtL","asin":"B01N8ZU8KV","title":"Evans Above","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Roger Clark","length":"6 hrs and 30 mins"},{"cover":"61CBirgF+cL","asin":"B00C4VZTCW","title":"For the Love of Mike","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Nicola Barber","length":"10 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"51Ry8FfCqVL","asin":"B00CO91EYG","title":"In Like Flynn","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Nicola Barber","length":"10 hrs and 24 mins"},{"cover":"51yGtia5-6L","asin":"B00CDNXR66","title":"Oh Danny Boy","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Nicola Barber","length":"11 hrs and 17 mins"},{"cover":"51zZZd8yRzL","asin":"B01MQMNAQJ","title":"Evan Help Us","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Roger Clark","length":"6 hrs and 51 mins"},{"cover":"51Bdz-iPzvL","asin":"B00H84QU32","title":"Tell Me, Pretty Maiden","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Nicola Barber","length":"11 hrs and 7 mins"},{"cover":"51vd2OxGvHL","asin":"B00H84QOVK","subHeading":"Molly Murphy Series, Book 6","title":"In Dublin's Fair City","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Nicola Barber","length":"9 hrs and 8 mins"},{"cover":"51xtKf78nzL","asin":"B00H7IBKTS","subHeading":"A Molly Murphy Mystery, Book 10","title":"Bless the Bride","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Nicola Barber","length":"9 hrs and 38 mins"},{"cover":"512wDrpR0VL","asin":"B00CYRCOR4","title":"In a Gilded Cage","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Nicola Barber","length":"8 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"51sqislG0mL","asin":"B01N458S73","title":"Evanly Choirs","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Roger Clark","length":"7 hrs and 28 mins"},{"cover":"6110LGSx8-L","asin":"B00H3R0LHU","title":"The Last Illusion","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Nicola Barber","length":"10 hrs and 11 mins"}],"added":195},{"asin":"B081ZFV1G3","cover":"51Us6vAMrsL","title":"Of Sea and Shadow: The Elder Empire: Sea, Book 1","authors":[{"name":"Will Wight","url":"B00D9S1IMO"}],"narrators":[{"name":"Travis Baldree"}],"series":[{"name":"The Elder Empire: Sea","asin":"B081V6TJLM","bookNumbers":["1"]}],"blurb":"The Guild of Navigators has ruled the Aion Sea for centuries, using their fleet of mystical ships to collect trade for the Aurelian Empire.

Each time, civilizations are ground to dust beneath the Demon King's hordes, but humanity has remained secure in the belief that a Hero of legend will always save them. There's just one slight problem. It's only been 23 years since the Demon King's latest rise, and this time, he's already conquered more than half the world.

And even if they succeed, the deadliest part of their journey may well be what awaits them at its end.</p>","releaseDate":"2014-09-23","publishers":[{"name":"Tantor Audio"}],"categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Humor & Satire","url":"18574496011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tant/004106/bk_tant_004106_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61BUyIzxsFL","asin":"B018UG3DJK","subHeading":"Spells, Swords, & Stealth Series #2","title":"Split the Party","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Roger Wayne","length":"11 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"615b2J3FgbL","asin":"B01NBOUV2D","subHeading":"Spells, Swords, & Stealth Series, Book 3","title":"Going Rogue","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Roger Wayne","length":"15 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"617gcI+Q4sL","asin":"1977378889","subHeading":"Spells, Swords, & Stealth Series, Book 4","title":"Siege Tactics","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Roger Wayne","length":"15 hrs and 15 mins"},{"cover":"61h4TKhp7NL","asin":"B06VV7NQJ5","subHeading":"Villains' Code Series, Book 1","title":"Forging Hephaestus","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Amy Landon","length":"26 hrs and 58 mins"},{"cover":"61jv-6yHq5L","asin":"B01FEAXNKO","subHeading":"Super Powereds, Book 1","title":"Super Powereds: Year 1","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Kyle McCarley","length":"26 hrs and 11 mins"},{"cover":"61ZHAA6jtKL","asin":"B01G11ZFYC","subHeading":"Super Powereds Spinoff, Book 1","title":"Corpies","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Kyle McCarley","length":"19 hrs and 50 mins"},{"cover":"514ppaAxSVL","asin":"B08S91CGBY","subHeading":"5-Minute Sherlock, Book 2","title":"The Case of the Haunted Haunted House","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Scott Aiello","length":"8 hrs and 6 mins"},{"cover":"612QJjMowPL","asin":"B01L7V7WNS","subHeading":"Fred, the Vampire Accountant, Book 3","title":"Bloody Acquisitions","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Kirby Heyborne","length":"9 hrs and 52 mins"},{"cover":"51KdVim8UUL","asin":"B07956BMDH","subHeading":"The Wraith's Haunt: A LitRPG Series, Book 1","title":"Dungeon Lord","authors":"Hugo Huesca","narrators":"Jeff Hays, Annie Ellicott","length":"9 hrs and 37 mins"},{"cover":"51hBJwW-ARL","asin":"B07FKY61BS","subHeading":"Fred, the Vampire Accountant Series, Book 5","title":"Deadly Assessments","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Kirby Heyborne","length":"9 hrs and 9 mins"},{"cover":"51WyO2OZfdL","asin":"B08S5H4MKG","subHeading":"Life Reset - Neo, Book 5","title":"Life Reset: Conquest","authors":"Shemer Kuznits","narrators":"Jeff Hays, Annie Ellicott, Laurie Catherine Winkel","length":"13 hrs and 18 mins"},{"cover":"51Q6W9XjRvL","asin":"B07D84P11M","subHeading":"Super Powereds, Book 4","title":"Super Powereds: Year 4","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Kyle McCarley","length":"60 hrs and 37 mins"},{"cover":"51T+N2n6FxL","asin":"1977346987","subHeading":"Fred, the Vampire Accountant Series 6","title":"Undeading Bells","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Kirby Heyborne","length":"11 hrs and 34 mins"},{"cover":"61I50WRR6qL","asin":"B077H6GG9Z","subHeading":"Fred, the Vampire Accountant Series, Book 4","title":"The Fangs of Freelance","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Kirby Heyborne","length":"8 hrs and 21 mins"},{"cover":"51ZKPg5M+YL","asin":"B00TIY6GH0","title":"The Utterly Uninteresting and Unadventurous Tales of Fred, the Vampire Accountant","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Kirby Heyborne","length":"7 hrs and 2 mins"},{"cover":"51b6+0vNoPL","asin":"1648816606","title":"Super Powereds: Year One (1 of 3) (Dramatized Adaptation)","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"full cast, Jonathan Lee Taylor, Darius Johnson, and others","length":"5 hrs and 57 mins"},{"cover":"41fJyK270ML","asin":"B07TDBYMPL","title":"Caverns and Creatures: Volume I (Books 1-4)","authors":"Robert Bevan","narrators":"Jonathan Sleep","length":"32 hrs and 43 mins"},{"cover":"61MQvtBgHCL","asin":"B07KWG9LBY","subHeading":"Archemi Online, Volume 1","title":"Dragon Seed","authors":"James Osiris Baldwin","narrators":"Justin Thomas James, Jeff Hays, Laurie Catherine Winkel","length":"12 hrs and 38 mins"}],"added":170},{"asin":"B00G2H1306","cover":"51ujBijhDAL","title":"Curtsies & Conspiracies: Finishing School, Book 2","authors":[{"name":"Gail Carriger","url":"B002BML6TE"}],"narrators":[{"name":"Moira Quirk"}],"series":[{"name":"Finishing School","asin":"B00G3DISCU","bookNumbers":["2"]}],"blurb":"Sophronia's first year at Mademoiselle Geraldine's Finishing Academy for Young Ladies of Quality has certainly been rousing!

Well, sort of. Life on Artemis, the first and only city on the moon, is tough if you're not a rich tourist or an eccentric billionaire. So smuggling in the occasional harmless bit of contraband barely counts, right? Not when you've got debts to pay and your job as a porter barely covers the rent. </p> <p>Everything changes when Jazz sees the chance to commit the perfect crime, with a reward too lucrative to turn down. But pulling off the impossible is just the start of her problems, as she learns that she's stepped square into a conspiracy for control of Artemis itself - and that now her only chance at survival lies in a gambit even riskier than the first. </p> <p>Bringing to life Weir's brash, whip-smart protagonist is actress Rosario Dawson (Marvel's <i>The Defenders</i>, <i>Sin City</i>, <i>Death Proof</i>). With the breathless immediacy of one realizing they're one cracked helmet visor away from oblivion, Dawson deftly captures Jazz's first-person perspective – all while delivering sarcastic Weir-ian one-liners and cracking wise in the face of death. And with a cast of diverse characters from all walks of life calling Artemis home, Dawson tonally somersaults to voice Kenyan prime ministers, Ukrainian scientists, and Saudi welders. It's a performance that transports listeners right alongside Jazz, matching her step for step on every lunar inch of her pulse-pounding journey. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-11-14","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"length":"8h 57m ","categories":[{"name":"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574597011"},{"name":"Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574621011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/027881/bk_adbl_027881_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51tuexbxdIL","asin":"B071Y9TTHC","title":"Children of Time","authors":"Adrian Tchaikovsky","narrators":"Mel Hudson","length":"16 hrs and 31 mins"},{"cover":"414J3xG+7+L","asin":"B082BHJMFF","title":"The Martian","authors":"Andy Weir","narrators":"Wil Wheaton","length":"10 hrs and 59 mins"},{"cover":"51CE3t95FqL","asin":"B007SP2LPM","subHeading":"A Novel with Three Codas","title":"Redshirts","authors":"John Scalzi","narrators":"Wil Wheaton","length":"7 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"51rLsWqI5-L","asin":"B01N48VJFJ","subHeading":"Expeditionary Force, Book 1","title":"Columbus Day","authors":"Craig Alanson","narrators":"R.C.

As the city prepares to celebrate Queen Victoria's golden jubilee, Veronica Speedwell is marking a milestone of her own. After burying her spinster aunt, the orphaned Veronica is free to resume her world travels in pursuit of scientific inquiry - and the occasional romantic dalliance. As familiar with hunting butterflies as she is fending off admirers, Veronica wields her butterfly net and a sharpened hatpin with equal aplomb, and with her last connection to England now gone, she intends to embark upon the journey of a lifetime. But fate has other plans, as Veronica discovers when she thwarts her own abduction with the help of an enigmatic German baron with ties to her mysterious past. Promising to reveal in time what he knows of the plot against her, the baron offers her temporary sanctuary in the care of his friend Stoker - a reclusive natural historian as intriguing as he is bad-tempered. But before the baron can deliver on his tantalizing vow to reveal the secrets he has concealed for decades, he is found murdered. Suddenly Veronica and Stoker are forced to go on the run from an elusive assailant, wary partners in search of the villainous truth. </p>","releaseDate":"2015-09-03","publishers":[{"name":"Recorded Books"}],"length":"10h 51m ","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Genre Fiction","url":"18574456011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/reco/008882/bk_reco_008882_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51++gmAM++L","asin":"B01NBPFSAW","title":"A Perilous Undertaking","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Angele Masters","length":"12 hrs and 25 mins"},{"cover":"51B3-QzwUML","asin":"B078JNYV9V","title":"A Treacherous Curse","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Angele Masters","length":"11 hrs and 49 mins"},{"cover":"51IVEZsrCJL","asin":"1501986171","title":"A Dangerous Collaboration","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Angele Masters","length":"12 hrs and 33 mins"},{"cover":"51xA5s0gqML","asin":"150198618X","subHeading":"Veronica Speedwell Mysteries, Book 5","title":"A Murderous Relation","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Angele Masters","length":"11 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"51iJoPticrL","asin":"B002V1OGB0","title":"Silent in the Grave","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Ellen Archer","length":"12 hrs and 54 mins"},{"cover":"511Np-ZkyKL","asin":"B002V0K4FI","title":"Silent in the Sanctuary","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Ellen Archer","length":"12 hrs and 29 mins"},{"cover":"51cb3muYo4L","asin":"B002V0QEAM","title":"Silent on the Moor","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Ellen Archer","length":"12 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"51kVHifEKlL","asin":"B00571RZSM","subHeading":"A Lady Julia Grey Novel","title":"The Dark Enquiry","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Ellen Archer","length":"11 hrs and 5 mins"},{"cover":"51GEtCb4WlL","asin":"B0042LJ1OY","title":"Dark Road to Darjeeling","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Ellen Archer","length":"11 hrs and 44 mins"},{"cover":"51fBzkWz7yL","asin":"059329209X","subHeading":"The Lady Sherlock Series, Book 5","title":"Murder on Cold Street","authors":"Sherry Thomas","narrators":"Kate Reading","length":"13 hrs and 15 mins"},{"cover":"51K5u0oXqxL","asin":"0593151550","subHeading":"The Lady Sherlock Series, Book 4","title":"The Art of Theft","authors":"Sherry Thomas","narrators":"Kate Reading","length":"10 hrs and 17 mins"},{"cover":"518vYcWLcbL","asin":"B00RC0S5KI","title":"Twelfth Night","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Ellen Archer","length":"1 hr and 58 mins"},{"cover":"51WPvDDOXQL","asin":"B00RC0S5XU","title":"Midsummer Night","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Ellen Archer","length":"2 hrs and 15 mins"},{"cover":"51Gk-j4cBQL","asin":"B009PANL3O","subHeading":"A Lady Julia Christmas Novella","title":"Silent Night","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Ellen Archer","length":"1 hr and 54 mins"},{"cover":"61yVLxOWu0L","asin":"B07KJSPB3W","subHeading":"Beatrice Hyde-Clare Mysteries, Book 1","title":"A Brazen Curiosity: A Regency Cozy","authors":"Lynn Messina","narrators":"Jill Smith","length":"7 hrs and 29 mins"},{"cover":"51DWIZoCIwL","asin":"B010EARZPS","title":"Bonfire Night","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Ellen Archer","length":"2 hrs and 4 mins"},{"cover":"51cWHxI7dAL","asin":"B07YSJ5MFZ","subHeading":"Heathcliff Lennox Series, Book 1","title":"Murder at Melrose Court","authors":"Karen Menuhin","narrators":"Sam Dewhurst-Phillips","length":"6 hrs and 25 mins"},{"cover":"518Rfim9p3L","asin":"B07PCX69DQ","subHeading":"Beatrice Hyde-Clare Mysteries, Book 2","title":"A Scandalous Deception: A Regency Cozy","authors":"Lynn Messina","narrators":"Jill Smith","length":"7 hrs and 21 mins"}],"added":147},{"asin":"B015RJL1Z6","cover":"51PJcOVR-TL","title":"Carmilla","authors":[{"name":"Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu","url":"B00456AFZA"}],"narrators":[{"name":"Phoebe Fox"},{"name":"Rose Leslie"},{"name":"David Tennant"},{"name":"David Horovitch"},{"name":"James Wilby"},{"name":"Susan Wooldridge"},{"name":"Hannah Genesius"}],"blurb":"Audible Originals bring you a brand new audiobook adaptation of J.

Told in alternating perspectives, it's the perfect love story for fans of the series and new listeners alike.&nbsp;</p> <p>Petite though she may be, Zuzana is not known for timidity. Her best friend, Karou, calls her \"rabid fairy\", her \"voodoo eyes\" are said to freeze blood, and even her older brother fears her wrath. But when it comes to the simple matter of talking to Mik, or \"Violin Boy\", her courage deserts her. Now, enough is enough. Zuzana is determined to meet him, and she has a fistful of magic and a plan. It's a wonderfully elaborate treasure hunt of a plan that will take Mik all over Prague on a cold winter's night before finally leading him to the treasure: herself!&nbsp;</p> <p>Violin Boy's not going to know what hit him.&nbsp;</p> <p>*Booktrack is an immersive format that pairs traditional audiobook narration to complementary music.

But when an out-of-control driver smashes into a buggy driven by Constance, Norma, and Fleurette Kopp, their lives change forever. Constance, the oldest, demands payment for the damages but quickly realizes that she is dealing with a madman - Henry Kaufman, a silk manufacturer with a drinking problem and a dangerous group of associates. </p> <p>Soon the Kopp home is under siege. The sisters face threats of arson, kidnapping, and white slavery. Bricks come flying through their windows, and shots are fired at their house late at night. Even the sheriff can't solve the case on his own. He issues revolvers to the Kopp sisters, posts guards at their house, and enlists Constance's help in catching Kaufman. In the process Constance finds herself pulled into an underworld of abused factory workers, missing children, and dirty dealings. </p> <p>Her attempts to help another woman in trouble forces her to confront her own past and imagine a different future for herself and her sisters.

All but doomed, her days are spent toiling away as a kitchen slave under the charge of the Aldermaston, the Abbey’s watchful overseer. But when an injured squire named Colvin is abandoned at the kitchen’s doorstep, an opportunity arises.

Charles Darwin's brilliant discovery challenged the creationist arguments; but only Richard Dawkins could have written this elegant riposte. Natural selection - the unconscious, automatic, blind, yet essentially nonrandom process Darwin discovered - is the blind watchmaker in nature.</p>","releaseDate":"2011-07-05","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"categories":null,"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/002905/bk_adbl_002905_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61eQEOTYw-L","asin":"B07MNH2T6M","subHeading":"Big Ideas Simply Explained","title":"The Philosophy Book","authors":"DK","narrators":"Jason Culp","length":"16 hrs and 22 mins"},{"cover":"51rn8IJrEhL","asin":"1682769992","title":"Black Holes, Tides, and Curved Spacetime","authors":"Benjamin Schumacher, The Great Courses","narrators":"Benjamin Schumacher","length":"12 hrs and 6 mins"},{"cover":"61DnhlAdt5L","asin":"B075B1ZM1Q","subHeading":"Einstein, Gravitational Waves, and the Future of Astronomy","title":"Ripples in Spacetime","authors":"Govert Schilling, Martin Rees","narrators":"Joel Richards","length":"11 hrs and 30 mins"},{"cover":"51v3mc89wtL","asin":"B003X3RJE6","subHeading":"A Story of Evolution in Our Time","title":"The Beak of the Finch","authors":"Jonathan Weiner","narrators":"Victor Bevine","length":"12 hrs and 14 mins"},{"cover":"510Y5qH15uL","asin":"B00375CTPE","subHeading":"The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time","title":"From Eternity to Here","authors":"Sean Carroll","narrators":"Erik Synnestvedt","length":"16 hrs and 4 mins"},{"cover":"61S4aDkYjsL","asin":"B00HFXCS96","subHeading":"Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies","title":"The Second Machine Age","authors":"Erik Brynjolfsson, Andrew McAfee","narrators":"Jeff Cummings","length":"8 hrs and 49 mins"},{"cover":"61gq5FFgFRL","asin":"B006P482NC","title":"The Origins of Political Order: From Prehuman Times to the French Revolution","authors":"Francis Fukuyama","narrators":"Jonathan Davis","length":"22 hrs and 34 mins"},{"cover":"51gEtUAPuKL","asin":"B07BH3R926","subHeading":"Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money","title":"The Case Against Education","authors":"Bryan Caplan","narrators":"Allan Robertson","length":"11 hrs"},{"cover":"61DuUi-PFKL","asin":"B0179XK9VU","subHeading":"The Phenomenon That Reimagines Space and Time-and What It Means for Black Holes, the Big Bang, and Theories of Everything","title":"Spooky Action at a Distance","authors":"George Musser","narrators":"William Hughes","length":"8 hrs and 37 mins"},{"cover":"41gvW2l0-9L","asin":"B00T3J3M54","subHeading":"Using Neuroscience to Reverse the Course of Depression, One Small Change at a Time","title":"The Upward Spiral","authors":"Alex Korb PhD.","narrators":"David deVries","length":"5 hrs and 34 mins"},{"cover":"61zewFaBaYL","asin":"B002V086LM","subHeading":"The Evidence for Evolution","title":"The Greatest Show on Earth","authors":"Richard Dawkins","narrators":"Richard Dawkins, Lalla Ward","length":"14 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"61LKr3EaaSL","asin":"B0062PG1Z0","subHeading":"The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla: Biography of a Genius","title":"Wizard","authors":"Marc J.

In Dr. Kaku's eyes, we are living in a golden age of physics, as new discoveries from the WMAP and COBE satellites and the Hubble space telescope have given us unprecedented pictures of our universe in its infancy. </p> <p>As astronomers wade through the avalanche of data from the WMAP satellite, a new cosmological picture is emerging. So far the leading theory about the birth of the universe is the \"inflationary universe theory\", a major refinement on the big bang theory. In this theory our universe may be but one in a multiverse, floating like a bubble in an infinite sea of bubble universes, with new universes being created all the time. A parallel universe may well hover a mere millimeter from our own. </p> <p>The very idea of parallel universes and the string theory that can explain their existence was once viewed with suspicion by scientists, seen as the province of mystics, charlatans, and cranks. But today physicists overwhelmingly support string theory and its latest iteration, M-theory, as it is this one theory that, if proven correct, would reconcile the four forces of the universe simply and elegantly and answer the question \"what happened before the big bang?\" </p> <p>Already, Kaku explains, the world's foremost physicists and astronomers are searching for ways to test the theory of the multiverse using highly sophisticated wave detectors, gravity lenses, satellites, and telescopes. The implications of M-theory are fascinating and endless. If parallel worlds do exist, Kaku speculates, in time - perhaps a trillion years or more from now, as appears likely - when our universe grows cold and dark in what scientists describe as a big freeze, advanced civilizations may well find a way to escape our universe in a kind of \"interdimensional lifeboat\". </p> <p>An unforgettable journey into black holes and time machines, alternate universes, and multidimensional space, <i>Parallel Worlds</i> gives us a compelling portrait of the revolution sweeping the world of cosmology. </p>","releaseDate":"2016-07-05","publishers":[{"name":"Random House Audio"}],"length":"14h 50m ","categories":[{"name":"Science & Engineering","url":"18580540011"},{"name":"Science","url":"18580555011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/rand/004635/bk_rand_004635_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"518fbTX6auL","asin":"B002V0GGGO","subHeading":"A Scientific Exploration","title":"Physics of the Impossible","authors":"Michio Kaku","narrators":"Feodor Chin","length":"11 hrs and 50 mins"},{"cover":"51UjXZTTHwL","asin":"B00HUBJ8NM","subHeading":"The Scientific Quest to Understand, Enhance, and Empower the Mind","title":"The Future of the Mind","authors":"Michio Kaku","narrators":"Feodor Chin","length":"15 hrs and 39 mins"},{"cover":"61S2HXwgipL","asin":"B075F9R9DD","subHeading":"Terraforming Mars, Interstellar Travel, Immortality, and Our Destiny Beyond Earth","title":"The Future of Humanity","authors":"Michio Kaku","narrators":"Feodor Chin","length":"12 hrs and 22 mins"},{"cover":"51VZakPBGpL","asin":"B004OFVVW8","subHeading":"How Science Will Shape Human Destiny and Our Daily Lives by the Year 2100","title":"Physics of the Future","authors":"Michio Kaku","narrators":"Feodor Chin","length":"15 hrs and 39 mins"},{"cover":"615wPw7acCL","asin":"B00CX727KE","subHeading":"How Albert Einstein's Vision Transformed Our Understanding of Space and Time: Great Discoveries","title":"Einstein's Cosmos","authors":"Michio Kaku","narrators":"Ray Porter","length":"6 hrs and 30 mins"},{"cover":"51HgJDRBbRL","asin":"B004GVIRFO","subHeading":"Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos","title":"The Hidden Reality","authors":"Brian Greene","narrators":"Brian Greene","length":"13 hrs and 48 mins"},{"cover":"51RbY4CYMxL","asin":"B002V1K1IM","subHeading":"Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality","title":"The Fabric of the Cosmos","authors":"Brian Greene","narrators":"Michael Prichard","length":"22 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"51AAyE4rGeL","asin":"B002V0TEUO","subHeading":"Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory","title":"The Elegant Universe","authors":"Brian Greene","narrators":"Erik Davies","length":"15 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"51fa7PyEWVL","asin":"0525592474","subHeading":"Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime","title":"Something Deeply Hidden","authors":"Sean Carroll","narrators":"Sean Carroll","length":"10 hrs and 9 mins"},{"cover":"51G9pDUq6IL","asin":"B01N7RT1ZG","subHeading":"An Astrophysical Tour","title":"Welcome to the Universe","authors":"Neil deGrasse Tyson, Michael A.

This lively comedy of manners with its witty and subtle exploration of relationships, it is often seen as Jane Austen's most flawless work.</p> <p>Featuring: Alexa Davies, Joanne Froggatt, Adam Gillen, Rupert Holliday-Evans, Isabella Inchbald, Aisling Loftus, Anjella Mackintosh, Joseph Millson, Ukweli Roach, Morgana Robinson, Nicholas Rowe, Emma Thompson, Benjamin Wainwright, Eve Webster and Ria Zmitrowicz.</p>","releaseDate":"2018-09-04","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"length":"8h 21m ","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Classics","url":"18574449011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/000226/or_orig_000226_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Original Recording Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51l+3eFfAmL","asin":"B0877BC6PP","title":"The Office","authors":"Whisperlodge","narrators":"Will Watt","length":"38 mins"},{"cover":"51NmlV2M8BL","asin":"B0877CXKYX","title":"Cape Cod National Seashore","authors":"Gordon Hempton","narrators":"54 mins","length":"Original Recording"},{"cover":"41NxWHKqMtL","asin":"B0877WF83H","title":"Loving Kindness","authors":"Bram Barouh","narrators":"Bram Barouh","length":"8 mins"},{"cover":"41xYKEMxgGL","asin":"B0877CK624","title":"The Perfect Swing","authors":"James McGirk","narrators":"Nick Jonas","length":"37 mins"},{"cover":"41bIKHsNriL","asin":"B0877CC66D","title":"Center Yourself","authors":"Agapi Stassinopoulos","narrators":"Agapi Stassinopoulos","length":"18 mins"},{"cover":"412zlrSCV2L","asin":"B0877CHZZ2","title":"Rest and Digest","authors":"Sara Auster","narrators":"Sara Auster","length":"10 mins"},{"cover":"51vY937eQYL","asin":"B0877DG21W","title":"You Are Here","authors":"Gabrielle Bernstein","narrators":"Gabrielle Bernstein","length":"7 mins"},{"cover":"51+Iu4yAJqL","asin":"B0877DSTBM","title":"Crystal Bowl Breathing","authors":"The Big Quiet","narrators":"Jesse Israel","length":"10 mins"},{"cover":"41dHfrJ-5OL","asin":"B0877D7PGV","title":"Honor Yourself","authors":"Diddy","narrators":"Diddy","length":"25 mins"},{"cover":"51TyQNTZVlL","asin":"B07FDJQ8YH","title":"Sense and Sensibility","authors":"Jane Austen","narrators":"Rosamund Pike","length":"11 hrs and 25 mins"},{"cover":"51YHL3AY2rL","asin":"B082MQ5TDB","title":"Phreaks","authors":"Matthew Derby","narrators":"Ben McKenzie, Carrie Coon, Christian Slater, and others","length":"5 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"518x9ZiVZbL","asin":"B08DDC8Y8F","title":"When You Finish Saving the World","authors":"Jesse Eisenberg","narrators":"Kaitlyn Dever, Jesse Eisenberg, Finn Wolfhard","length":"5 hrs and 17 mins"},{"cover":"51Di+gUJ9HL","asin":"B08DDCVRRC","title":"Thicker than Water","authors":"Tyler Shultz","narrators":"Tyler Shultz","length":"3 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"513oKbpMTgL","asin":"B08DDJ56J2","title":"The Year of Magical Thinking","authors":"Joan Didion","narrators":"Vanessa Redgrave","length":"1 hr and 28 mins"},{"cover":"51NK159FbkL","asin":"B089T5SW3N","title":"Dan Rather: Stories of a Lifetime","authors":"Dan Rather","narrators":"Dan Rather","length":"1 hr and 24 mins"},{"cover":"51GKoszPFmL","asin":"B085F3F6CX","title":"Stuck","authors":"Chris Grabenstein","narrators":"Mark Sanderlin, Elizabeth Hess, Oliver Wyman, and others","length":"3 hrs and 12 mins"},{"cover":"51aNFG4ELmL","asin":"B072JZ18JB","subHeading":"An Audible Original Drama","title":"Northanger Abbey","authors":"Jane Austen, Anna Lea - adaptation","narrators":"Emma Thompson, Douglas Booth, Eleanor Tomlinson, and others","length":"6 hrs and 6 mins"},{"cover":"51Hhvqc6SML","asin":"B0883GHNZQ","title":"Bella Bella","authors":"Harvey Fierstein","narrators":"Harvey Fierstein","length":"1 hr and 13 mins"}],"added":81},{"asin":"B07FKTV9PG","cover":"51MUCSJQbQL","title":"Once Upon a River","authors":[{"name":"Diane Setterfield","url":"B001H6IYHC"}],"narrators":[{"name":"Juliet Stevenson"}],"blurb":"A body always tells a story - but this child’s was a blank page. \"Who are you?\" she murmured, but the face said as little as the rest of her.

Each wave different, and each wave stronger.</i> </p> <p>Ray Bradbury is a storyteller without peer, a poet of the possible, and, indisputably, one of America's most beloved authors. In a much-celebrated literary career that has spanned six decades, he has produced an astonishing body of work: unforgettable novels, including <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> and <i>Something Wicked This Way Comes</i>; essays, theatrical works, screenplays and teleplays; <i>The Illustrated Mein</i>, <i>Dandelion Wine</i>, <i>The October Country</i>, and numerous other superb short story collections. But of all the dazzling stars in the vast Bradbury universe, none shines more luminous than these masterful chronicles of Earth's settlement of the fourth world from the sun. </p> <p>Bradbury's Mars is a place of hope, dreams, and metaphor - of crystal pillars and fossil seas - where a fine dust settles on the great, empty cities of a silently destroyed civilization. It is here the invaders have come to despoil and commercialize, to grow and to learn - first a trickle, then a torrent, rushing from a world with no future toward a promise of tomorrow. The Earthman conquers Mars...and then is conquered by it, lulled by dangerous lies of comfort and familiarity, and enchanted by the lingering glamour of an ancient, mysterious native race. </p> <p>Ray Bradbury's <i>The Martian Chronicles</i> is a classic work of 20th-century literature whose extraordinary power and imagination remain undimmed by time's passage. In connected, chronological stories, a true grandmaster once again enthralls, delights, and challenges us with his vision and his heart - starkly and stunningly exposing in brilliant spacelight our strength, our weakness, our folly, and our poignant humanity on a strange and breathtaking world where humanity does not belong.</p>","releaseDate":"2014-10-21","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"length":"7h 43m ","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Classics","url":"18574449011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/018699/bk_adbl_018699_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51JtgYHw50L","asin":"B003Z428D0","title":"The Illustrated Man","authors":"Ray Bradbury","narrators":"Scott Brick","length":"9 hrs and 4 mins"},{"cover":"5172mjVg2KL","asin":"B00KQBMIBW","title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","authors":"Ray Bradbury","narrators":"Christian Rummel","length":"9 hrs and 5 mins"},{"cover":"61AEXh2FA6L","asin":"B07DFS18PQ","title":"The October Country","authors":"Ray Bradbury","narrators":"David Aaron Baker","length":"10 hrs and 59 mins"},{"cover":"51fA4UHQkNL","asin":"B07815BZBZ","title":"Dandelion Wine","authors":"Ray Bradbury","narrators":"David Aaron Baker","length":"8 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"51VkYmskdQL","asin":"B01EVPMGEM","title":"Martian Time-Slip","authors":"Philip K.

Now, in yet another virtuosic performance, the actor proves that despite being separated by a span of over a century, his connection to the author and his work is undeniable and that theirs is a timeless collaboration that should not be missed. Trading in the idyllic banks of Twain's Mississippi for medieval England, Offerman regales listeners with one of American literature's foremost satires and the author's most inventive and darkly funny pieces of fiction. </p> <p>Hank Morgan is the archetype of modern man in 19th-century New England: adept at his trade as a mechanic, innovative, forward thinking. So when a blow to the head inexplicably sends him back in time 1300 years and places him in Camelot, instead of despair, he feels emboldened by the prospect placed before him and sets out to modernize and improve the lives of his fellow citizens. But, in order to do so, he'll need to contend with brash nobles, superstitious nincompoops, and a conniving, blowhard wizard. </p> <p>While time travel has become a common trope in storytelling today, in Twain's time it was truly a novel idea; all the more imaginative when you consider how it's used for satirical effect. A thinly veiled critique of the political and social institutions that impede progress and a scathing condemnation of the naiveté that allows them to thrive, <i>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</i> saw Twain's biting wit and sharp tongue honed to a fine point. </p> <p>Told primarily through Hank's first-person perspective, Offerman effortlessly captures the Yankee's straightforward, matter-of-fact gruffness. Like Offerman - whose woodworking skills are the stuff of legend - Hank is a natural builder of things and his can-do, by-the-bootstraps spirit finds its vocal foil in Offerman's crisp delivery. But it's in Offerman's ability to convey the myriad characters and absurdities Hank faces that makes this an incomparable listening experience: the flowery embellishments and insane braggadocio of knights; the lilting, feathery sing-song of Clarence; the garrulous, long-winded pomp of the aristocracy; the old, dithering windbag pronouncements of Merlin. Offerman plays each of these with a humor and humanity that Twain himself would have enjoyed. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-09-19","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"length":"13h 25m ","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Classics","url":"18574449011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/029631/bk_adbl_029631_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61OhDUE9CKL","asin":"B01HQMQLWK","title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer","authors":"Mark Twain","narrators":"Nick Offerman","length":"7 hrs and 52 mins"},{"cover":"51ef+s6y42L","asin":"B0078PA1OA","title":"Dracula [Audible Edition]","authors":"Bram Stoker","narrators":"Alan Cumming, Tim Curry, Simon Vance, and others","length":"15 hrs and 28 mins"},{"cover":"61ZRKnCssaL","asin":"B01FN88BHC","title":"Anna Karenina","authors":"Leo Tolstoy","narrators":"Maggie Gyllenhaal","length":"35 hrs and 35 mins"},{"cover":"51vyUoMpjkL","asin":"B076DJLFRF","title":"Murder in an English Village","authors":"Jessica Ellicott","narrators":"Barbara Rosenblat","length":"9 hrs and 26 mins"},{"cover":"51UV56nCgvL","asin":"B06VX4GHHG","subHeading":"Life Lessons","title":"I Can't Make This Up","authors":"Neil Strauss - contributor, Kevin Hart","narrators":"Kevin Hart","length":"11 hrs and 15 mins"},{"cover":"51WstlmPV6L","asin":"B00K0S7MQW","title":"The Age of Faith, Volume 4","authors":"Will Durant","narrators":"Stefan Rudnicki","length":"61 hrs and 23 mins"},{"cover":"61j+AB3GUoL","asin":"B06X9MXN32","title":"Astrophysics for People in a Hurry","authors":"Neil deGrasse Tyson","narrators":"Neil deGrasse Tyson","length":"3 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"51Sc+GQHn-L","asin":"B00D94TX02","title":"1066: The Year That Changed Everything","authors":"Jennifer Paxton, The Great Courses","narrators":"Jennifer Paxton","length":"3 hrs"},{"cover":"61uvEAJX2yL","asin":"B002V5IX3I","title":"Joan of Arc","authors":"Mark Twain","narrators":"Michael Anthony","length":"15 hrs and 42 mins"},{"cover":"51Wl2hPRt5L","asin":"B00FFHJXSI","title":"The Things They Carried","authors":"Tim O'Brien","narrators":"Bryan Cranston","length":"7 hrs and 47 mins"},{"cover":"51R3eluF7jL","asin":"B00NQDMLSW","subHeading":"A History of Civilization in Italy from 1304 - 1576 AD, The Story of Civilization, Volume 5","title":"The Renaissance","authors":"Will Durant","narrators":"Grover Gardner","length":"37 hrs and 9 mins"},{"cover":"61IW-XFc9sL","asin":"B004GVNIEY","title":"Life on the Mississippi [Blackstone]","authors":"Mark Twain","narrators":"Grover Gardner","length":"13 hrs and 37 mins"},{"cover":"51eo26hWHLL","asin":"B005QPB3X2","subHeading":"How the World Became Modern","title":"The Swerve","authors":"Stephen Greenblatt","narrators":"Edoardo Ballerini","length":"9 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"61BgXkJCauL","asin":"B002V0TGKM","title":"Oliver Twist","authors":"Charles Dickens","narrators":"Simon Vance","length":"16 hrs and 7 mins"},{"cover":"51Y1Wy710HL","asin":"B01COOZ5C2","title":"Jane Eyre","authors":"Charlotte Bronte","narrators":"Thandie Newton","length":"19 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"5127OtHzHuL","asin":"B00FQRCM9O","title":"Frankenstein","authors":"Mary Shelley","narrators":"Dan Stevens","length":"8 hrs and 35 mins"},{"cover":"51y-ivhKErL","asin":"B016LN23CC","title":"Pride and Prejudice","authors":"Jane Austen","narrators":"Rosamund Pike","length":"11 hrs and 35 mins"},{"cover":"51AyV7rsScL","asin":"B015ELUYL4","title":"Slaughterhouse-Five","authors":"Kurt Vonnegut","narrators":"James Franco","length":"5 hrs and 13 mins"}],"added":63},{"asin":"B002UZMVSC","cover":"51zv-hPTgKL","title":"House of Many Ways","authors":[{"name":"Diana Wynne Jones","url":"B000AP7PX0"}],"narrators":[{"name":"Jenny Sterlin"}],"series":[{"name":"Howl's Castle","asin":"B073V4CGZN","bookNumbers":["3"]}],"blurb":"A girl named Charmain must inhabit her ailing great-uncle's time-traveling home full of magical belongings....","downloaded":true,"progress":"Finished","myRating":"5","titleShort":"House of Many Ways","ratings":1347,"rating":4.7,"summary":"Recipient of two Boston Globe-Horn Book Award Honors, beloved fantasy and children's author Diana Wynne Jones presents this exciting sequel to her novel <i>Howl's Moving Castle</i>, which was transformed into an Academy Award®-nominated motion picture. <p>A girl named Charmain must inhabit her ailing great-uncle's time-traveling home full of magical belongings.

Wizardly partners Kit Rodriguez and Nita Callahan, and Nita's sister, former wizard-prodigy Dairine Callahan, are drafted in to mentor two brilliant and difficult cases: for Nita and Kit, there's Penn Shao-Feng, a would-be sun technician with a dangerous new take on managing solar weather; and for Dairine, there's shy young Mehrnaz Farrahi, an Iranian wizard-girl trying to specialize in defusing earthquakes while struggling with a toxic extended wizardly family that demands she perform to their expectations. </p> <p>Together they're plunged into a whirlwind of cutthroat competition and ruthless judging.

Mindy Kaling really is just a Girl Next Door—not so much literally anywhere in the continental United States, but definitely if you live in India or Sri Lanka.</p>","releaseDate":"2011-11-01","publishers":[{"name":"Random House Audio"}],"length":"4h 37m ","categories":[{"name":"Arts & Entertainment","url":"18571910011"},{"name":"Entertainment & Performing Arts","url":"18571923011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/rand/002813/bk_rand_002813_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51KbRtqG7cL","asin":"1721376658","subHeading":"Nothing Like I Imagined","title":"Please Like Me (But Keep Away)","authors":"Mindy Kaling","narrators":"Mindy Kaling","length":"29 mins"},{"cover":"51CMssMdGXL","asin":"B01ETUKSM6","title":"Scrappy Little Nobody","authors":"Anna Kendrick","narrators":"Anna Kendrick","length":"6 hrs"},{"cover":"51d8yzzs2vL","asin":"B01478ZQOU","subHeading":"My Life in Art, Faith, and Idiocy","title":"The Bassoon King","authors":"Rainn Wilson","narrators":"Rainn Wilson","length":"8 hrs and 49 mins"},{"cover":"51wc5HBeMlL","asin":"B007MWI0QK","subHeading":"Comedy Calamities, Dating Disasters, and a Midlife Miracle","title":"Girl Walks into a Bar...","authors":"Rachel Dratch","narrators":"Rachel Dratch","length":"5 hrs and 12 mins"},{"cover":"51gGIbA6nKL","asin":"B00HUBJ9Q8","subHeading":"Stories and Other Stories","title":"One More Thing","authors":"B.

You’re so clean that you’re dirty and you murmur your first word to me - hello.</i> </p> <p>When aspiring writer and recent Brown graduate Guinevere Beck strides into the bookstore where Joe works, he’s instantly smitten. Beck is everything Joe has ever wanted: she's gorgeous, tough, razor-smart, and sexy beyond his wildest dreams. Joe needs to have her, and he'll stop at nothing to do so. As he begins to insinuate himself into her life - her friendships, her email, her phone - she can’t resist her feelings for a guy who seems custom-made for her. So when her boyfriend, Benji, mysteriously disappears, Beck and Joe fall into a tumultuous affair. But there's more to Beck than her oh-so-perfect façade, and their mutual obsession quickly spirals into a whirlwind of deadly consequences. </p> <p>Dark, masterful, and timely, debut novelist Caroline Kepnes' <i>You</i> is a perversely romantic thriller that's more dangerously clever than any you've heard before.

She is about to start seventh grade, and for kids from Maine's Burning Fog Island, that means leaving their little white schoolhouse for regular classrooms and life on the mainland. Everyone assures Christina it will be a fantastic year. Mainland school offers great advantages, after all: extracurricular activities other than boating and fishing, a gym, a cafeteria, and more kids her age. Best of all, this year the boarding students will live at the historic Schooner Inne, a former sea captain's house (and now a bed and breakfast) recently bought by the school's charismatic new principal and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Shevvington. </p><p>But Christina is apprehensive. She adores the wildness and excitement of her island life. Boarding with her island friends will surely help: Anya, a beautiful senior, fifteen-year-old Benji, the aspiring lobsterman, and his crush-worthy younger brother Michael. But Christina's apprehension sharpens when Benji and Michael aren't as friendly as they used to be on the island, and Anya starts acting so strangely it seems she is slowly losing her mind. Christina is increasingly certain the Shevvingtons are behind all of these changes. But no one else can see the Shevvingtons' eerie behavior - not other teachers, not her parents, not even her fellow island kids.

A brilliant young boy, Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut - young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister.

Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick's clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River.

A world in which a handful of panicky survivors choose sides - or are chosen. A world in which good rides on the frail shoulders of the 108-year-old Mother Abagail - and the worst nightmares of evil are embodied in a man with a lethal smile and unspeakable powers: Randall Flagg, the dark man.</p> <p>In 1978, Stephen King published <i>The Stand</i>, the novel that is now considered to be one of his finest works. But as it was first published, <i>The Stand</i> was incomplete, since more than 150,000 words had been cut from the original manuscript.</p> <p>Now Stephen King's apocalyptic vision of a world blasted by plague and embroiled in an elemental struggle between good and evil has been restored to its entirety. <i>The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition</i> includes material previously deleted, along with new material that King added as he reworked the manuscript for a new generation.

Like his fellow Reds, he works all day, believing that he and his people are making the surface of Mars livable for future generations. Yet he spends his life willingly, knowing that his blood and sweat will one day result in a better world for his children. But Darrow and his kind have been betrayed. Soon he discovers that humanity reached the surface generations ago. Vast cities and sprawling parks spread across the planet. </p> <p>Darrow - and Reds like him - are nothing more than slaves to a decadent ruling class.

Scores of time-traveling historians are being sent into the past, to destinations including the American Civil War and the attack on the World Trade Center. Michael Davies is prepping to go to Pearl Harbor. Merope Ward is coping with a bunch of bratty 1940 evacuees and trying to talk her thesis adviser, Mr. Dunworthy, into letting her go to VE Day. Polly Churchill's next assignment will be as a shopgirl in the middle of London's Blitz. And 17-year-old Colin Templer, who has a major crush on Polly, is determined to go to the Crusades so that he can catch up to her in age. But now the time-travel lab is suddenly canceling assignments for no apparent reason and switching around everyones schedules. And when Michael, Merope, and Polly finally get to World War II, things just get worse. For there they face air raids, blackouts, unexploded bombs, dive-bombing Stukas, rationing, shrapnel, V-1s, and two of the most incorrigible children in all of history to say nothing of a growing feeling that not only their assignments but the war and history itself are spiraling out of control. Because suddenly the once-reliable mechanisms of time travel are showing significant glitches, and our heroes are beginning to question their most firmly held belief: that no historian can possibly change the past.</p> <p><b>BONUS AUDIO: In an exclusive introduction, author Connie Willis discusses her fascination with WWII and the historic context of <i>Blackout</i>.</b> </p> <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE: <i>Blackout</i> is the first volume of a two-part novel.

The Civil War is less than one year old. The fighting has begun in earnest, and the nation has begun to realize it is in for a long, bloody struggle. Meanwhile, President Lincoln’s beloved 11-year-old son, Willie, lies upstairs in the White House, gravely ill. In a matter of days, despite predictions of a recovery, Willie dies and is laid to rest in a Georgetown cemetery.&nbsp;</p> <p>“My poor boy, he was too good for this earth,” the president says at the time. “God has called him home.” Newspapers report that a grief-stricken Lincoln returns, alone, to the crypt several times to hold his boy’s body. From that seed of historical truth, George Saunders spins an unforgettable story of familial love and loss that breaks free of its realistic, historical framework into a supernatural realm both hilarious and terrifying. Willie Lincoln finds himself in a strange purgatory where ghosts mingle, gripe, commiserate, quarrel, and enact bizarre acts of penance. Within this transitional state—called, in the Tibetan tradition, the bardo—a monumental struggle erupts over young Willie’s soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Lincoln in the Bardo</i> is an astonishing feat of imagination and a bold step forward from one of the most important and influential writers of his generation. Formally daring, generous in spirit, deeply concerned with matters of the heart, it is a testament to fiction’s ability to speak honestly and powerfully to the things that really matter to us. Saunders has invented a thrilling new form that deploys a kaleidoscopic, theatrical panorama of voices to ask a timeless, profound question: How do we live and love when we know that everything we love must end?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The 166-person full cast features award-winning actors and musicians, as well as a number of Saunders’ family, friends, and members of his publishing team, including, in order of their appearance:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Nick Offerman as Hans Vollman <br> David Sedaris as Roger Bevins III <br> Carrie Brownstein as Isabelle Perkins <br> George Saunders as The Reverend Everly Thomas <br> Miranda July as Mrs. Elizabeth Crawford <br> Lena Dunham as Elise Traynor <br> Ben Stiller as Jack Manders <br> Julianne Moore as Jane Ellis <br> Susan Sarandon as Mrs. Abigail Blass <br> Bradley Whitford as Lt.

Now, let's see who answers the challenge.” (<i>Chicago Tribune)</i></p> <p>“Like the novel, the audiobook breaks new ground in what can be accomplished through a story. It helps that there’s not a single bad note in the cast of a whopping 166 people. It’s also the rare phenomenon of an audiobook being a completely different experience compared to the novel. Even if you’ve read the novel, the audiobook is worth a listen (and vice versa). The whole project pushes the narrative form forward.” (A.V. Club)</p> <p>“The result is an auditory experience unlike any other, where the awareness of individual voices disappears while the carefully calibrated soundscape summons a metaphysical masterpiece. This is a tour de force of audiobook production, and a dazzling realization of Saunders’ unique authorial structure.” (<i>Booklist</i>)</p> <p>“The finished audiobook’s tapestry of voices perfectly mirrors the novel.” (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>)</p>","publishers":[{"name":"Random House Audio"}],"categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Genre Fiction","url":"18574456011"}],"language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51+OHYs7OKL","asin":"059339402X","subHeading":"In Which Four Russians Give a Master Class on Writing, Reading, and Life","title":"A Swim in a Pond in the Rain","authors":"George Saunders","narrators":"George Saunders, Phylicia Rashad, Nick Offerman, and others","length":"14 hrs and 44 mins"},{"cover":"516OQW3OLYL","asin":"B00AU56AI6","subHeading":"Stories","title":"Tenth of December","authors":"George Saunders","narrators":"George Saunders","length":"5 hrs and 40 mins"},{"cover":"51WaX0908xL","asin":"0593147189","title":"Pastoralia","authors":"George Saunders","narrators":"George Saunders","length":"4 hrs and 31 mins"},{"cover":"61nIzk6CNdL","asin":"B013S5I6B8","title":"Lafayette in the Somewhat United States","authors":"Sarah Vowell","narrators":"Sarah Vowell, John Slattery, Nick Offerman, and others","length":"8 hrs and 7 mins"},{"cover":"61AjViVTs7L","asin":"059314712X","subHeading":"Stories and a Novella","title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","authors":"George Saunders, Joshua Ferris - introduction","narrators":"George Saunders, Joshua Ferris","length":"5 hrs and 31 mins"},{"cover":"51MuVFGerqL","asin":"B002V0QPH4","title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","authors":"David Sedaris","narrators":"David Sedaris","length":"5 hrs and 51 mins"},{"cover":"51NJs+Rj6hL","asin":"0525637141","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Vanishing Half","authors":"Brit Bennett","narrators":"Shayna Small","length":"11 hrs and 34 mins"},{"cover":"61TYW6dmRDL","asin":"0593147200","title":"In Persuasion Nation","authors":"George Saunders","narrators":"George Saunders","length":"5 hrs and 31 mins"},{"cover":"41H5Lvsgr9L","asin":"B0042FWTTE","subHeading":"A Short History of Private Life","title":"At Home","authors":"Bill Bryson","narrators":"Bill Bryson","length":"16 hrs and 33 mins"},{"cover":"511ewzvkNnL","asin":"B00NJ58S5W","subHeading":"Nine Tales","title":"Stone Mattress","authors":"Margaret Atwood","narrators":"Margaret Atwood, Rob Delaney, Mark Bramhall, and others","length":"10 hrs and 2 mins"},{"cover":"51ewjTW-w1L","asin":"0062963708","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Dutch House","authors":"Ann Patchett","narrators":"Tom Hanks","length":"9 hrs and 53 mins"},{"cover":"61UKeax0hLL","asin":"B00BWA3S3S","title":"Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe","authors":"Benjamin Alire Saenz","narrators":"Lin-Manuel Miranda","length":"7 hrs and 29 mins"},{"cover":"51JfBtfchnL","asin":"0593339800","subHeading":"The Origins of Our Discontents","title":"Caste (Oprah's Book Club)","authors":"Isabel Wilkerson","narrators":"Robin Miles","length":"14 hrs and 26 mins"},{"cover":"41uaH6isKoL","asin":"B07BGGTGBQ","title":"Calypso","authors":"David Sedaris","narrators":"David Sedaris","length":"6 hrs and 39 mins"},{"cover":"61wBl9XtMSL","asin":"0593107063","title":"Such a Fun Age","authors":"Kiley Reid","narrators":"Nicole Lewis","length":"9 hrs and 58 mins"},{"cover":"513zptSvk4L","asin":"B00YQEF862","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Sellout","authors":"Paul Beatty","narrators":"Prentice Onayemi","length":"9 hrs and 35 mins"},{"cover":"51GkiZYaC9L","asin":"0593166981","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Deacon King Kong","authors":"James McBride","narrators":"Dominic Hoffman","length":"14 hrs and 5 mins"},{"cover":"41PAC97HKBL","asin":"1549150340","subHeading":"What We Should Know About the People We Don't Know","title":"Talking to Strangers","authors":"Malcolm Gladwell","narrators":"Malcolm Gladwell","length":"8 hrs and 42 mins"}],"added":37},{"asin":"B002VA94WW","title":"Wildwood Dancing","cover":"61hU+npOJkL","sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/lili/000935/bk_lili_000935_sample.mp3","series":[{"name":"Wildwood Dancing","asin":"/series","bookNumbers":["1"]}],"length":"12h 53m ","releaseDate":"2009-01-13","rating":4.3,"ratings":418,"authors":[{"name":"Juliet Marillier","url":"B001ILM9KE"}],"narrators":[{"name":"Kim Mai Guest"}],"dateAdded":"2019-09-26","titleShort":"Wildwood Dancing","summary":"High in the Transylvanian woods, at the castle Piscul Draculi, live five daughters and their doting father.

As a result, successes and failures in life are often attributed to clear and obvious causes, when in actuality they are more profoundly influenced by chance. <p>The rise and fall of your favorite movie star or the most reviled CEO - in fact, all our destinies - reflects chance as much as planning and innate abilities. Even Roger Maris, who beat Babe Ruth's single season home-run record, was in all likelihood not great but just lucky.</p> <p>How could it have happened that a wine was given five out of five stars by one journal and called the worst wine of the decade by another? Wine ratings, school grades, political polls, and many other things in daily life are less reliable than we believe. By showing us the true nature of chance and revealing the psychological illusions that cause us to misjudge the world around us, Mlodinow gives fresh insight into what is really meaningful and how we can make decisions based on a deeper truth. From the classroom to the courtroom, from financial markets to supermarkets, from the doctor's office to the Oval Office, Mlodinow's insights will intrigue, awe, and inspire.</p> <p>Offering listeners not only a tour of randomness, chance and probability but also a new way of looking at the world, this original, unexpected journey reminds us that much in our lives is about as predictable as the steps of a stumbling man afresh from a night at a bar.</p>","publishers":[{"name":"Gildan Media, LLC"}],"categories":[{"name":"Business & Careers","url":"18572029011"},{"name":"Career Success","url":"18572070011"}],"language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51c4K4m1zrL","asin":"B007NKZ1RW","subHeading":"How Your Unconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior","title":"Subliminal","authors":"Leonard Mlodinow","narrators":"Leonard Mlodinow","length":"7 hrs and 56 mins"},{"cover":"51FHLHfTCBL","asin":"B002V8H28C","subHeading":"The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets","title":"Fooled by Randomness","authors":"Nassim Nicholas Taleb","narrators":"Sean Pratt","length":"10 hrs and 3 mins"},{"cover":"41hva6GlZeL","asin":"B077BV9FG5","subHeading":"Flexible Thinking in a Time of Change","title":"Elastic","authors":"Leonard Mlodinow","narrators":"Leonard Mlodinow","length":"7 hrs and 34 mins"},{"cover":"61uvnMk-IDL","asin":"1549100378","subHeading":"How to Learn from Data","title":"The Art of Statistics","authors":"David Spiegelhalter","narrators":"Jonathan Davis","length":"9 hrs and 1 min"},{"cover":"512uf60gabL","asin":"B006K4GN56","subHeading":"Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself","title":"You Are Not So Smart","authors":"David McRaney","narrators":"Don Hagen","length":"8 hrs and 24 mins"},{"cover":"51LsfuzFU7L","asin":"B00VQTE4OC","subHeading":"The Making of Behavioral Economics","title":"Misbehaving","authors":"Richard Thaler","narrators":"L.

For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the \"Sliver of Infinity,\" reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison.&nbsp;</p> <p>Kelsier \"snapped\" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark. Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot. But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life.&nbsp;</p> <p>Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets, and gotten it. She will have to learn to trust, if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed.&nbsp;</p> <p>This saga dares to ask a simple question: What if the hero of prophecy fails?</p> <p>Other

But when his father and three sons in line for the throne are killed in an \"accident,\" he has no choice but to take his place as the only surviving rightful heir. Entirely unschooled in the art of court politics, he has no friends, no advisors, and the sure knowledge that whoever assassinated his father and brothers could make an attempt on his life at any moment. Surrounded by sycophants eager to curry favor with the naïve new emperor, and overwhelmed by the burdens of his new life, he can trust nobody. Amid the swirl of plots to depose him, offers of arranged marriages, and the specter of the unknown conspirators who lurk in the shadows, he must quickly adjust to life as the Goblin Emperor. All the while, he is alone, and trying to find even a single friend - and hoping for the possibility of romance, yet also vigilant against the unseen enemies that threaten him, lest he lose his throne-or his life.</p>","publishers":[{"name":"Tantor Audio"}],"categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51WQ6veQtgL","asin":"1250755298","title":"The Angel of the Crows","authors":"Katherine Addison","narrators":"Imogen Church","length":"16 hrs and 2 mins"},{"cover":"41fsc0JPO1L","asin":"B002V0M5FU","title":"The Curse of Chalion","authors":"Lois McMaster Bujold","narrators":"Lloyd James","length":"18 hrs and 40 mins"},{"cover":"51qUHKlyTeL","asin":"140554628X","title":"Sixteen Ways to Defend a Walled City","authors":"K.

It begins with a North Carolina childhood filled with speech-therapy classes (\"There was the lisp, of course, but more troubling than that was my voice itself, with its excitable tone and high, girlish pitch\") and unwanted guitar lessons taught by a midget. From budding performance artist (\"The only crimp in my plan was that I seemed to have no talent whatsoever\") to \"clearly unqualified\" writing teacher in Chicago, Sedaris' career leads him to New York City and eventually, of all places, France. His move to Paris poses a number of challenges, chief among them his inability to speak the language. Arriving a \"spooky man-child\" capable of communicating only through nouns, he undertakes language instruction that leads him ever deeper into cultural confusion. Whether describing the Easter bunny to puzzled classmates or watching a group of men play soccer with a cow, Sedaris brings a view and a voice like no other to every unforgettable encounter.","publishers":[{"name":"Hachette Audio"}],"categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"Art & Literature","url":"18571953011"}],"language":"English","format":"Abridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51HBIApEyjL","asin":"B002V0Q05G","title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","authors":"David Sedaris","narrators":"David Sedaris","length":"6 hrs and 18 mins"},{"cover":"41v0WrMrMTL","asin":"B002V0JVOI","title":"Naked","authors":"David Sedaris","narrators":"David Sedaris, Amy Sedaris","length":"3 hrs and 4 mins"},{"cover":"41uaH6isKoL","asin":"B07BGGTGBQ","title":"Calypso","authors":"David Sedaris","narrators":"David Sedaris","length":"6 hrs and 39 mins"},{"cover":"51LeLAkudxL","asin":"B002V1BQ1I","title":"When You Are Engulfed in Flames","authors":"David Sedaris","narrators":"David Sedaris","length":"9 hrs and 3 mins"},{"cover":"517E3HI6ZIL","asin":"B00C6LVQ0E","title":"Let's Explore Diabetes with Owls","authors":"David Sedaris","narrators":"David Sedaris","length":"6 hrs and 25 mins"},{"cover":"61-RvWi6LxL","asin":"B002V5BV9G","subHeading":"Featuring Six New Stories","title":"Holidays on Ice","authors":"David Sedaris","narrators":"David Sedaris","length":"4 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"518nxGOOmRL","asin":"1549160761","title":"The Best of Me","authors":"David Sedaris","narrators":"David Sedaris","length":"13 hrs and 8 mins"},{"cover":"51WkKhjrszL","asin":"B01N384PPA","subHeading":"Diaries (1977-2002)","title":"Theft by Finding","authors":"David Sedaris","narrators":"David Sedaris","length":"13 hrs and 52 mins"},{"cover":"51q42wnXJjL","asin":"B002V0QVIC","title":"Barrel Fever and Other Stories","authors":"David Sedaris","narrators":"David Sedaris, Amy Sedaris","length":"2 hrs and 59 mins"},{"cover":"519PrExiLbL","asin":"B0036GRHZG","subHeading":"Live for Your Listening Pleasure","title":"David Sedaris","authors":"David Sedaris","narrators":"David Sedaris","length":"1 hr and 14 mins"},{"cover":"51Sri0WJm0L","asin":"B002V5B9T8","title":"David Sedaris Live at Carnegie Hall","authors":"David Sedaris","narrators":"David Sedaris","length":"1 hr and 13 mins"},{"cover":"51JHcI5fVnL","asin":"B0042QTX3S","subHeading":"A Modest Bestiary","title":"Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk","authors":"David Sedaris","narrators":"David Sedaris, Dylan Baker, Elaine Stritch, and others","length":"3 hrs"},{"cover":"51L-pdN6j4L","asin":"1799700135","subHeading":"An Essay","title":"Themes and Variations","authors":"David Sedaris","narrators":"David Sedaris","length":"30 mins"},{"cover":"41HTNhmmYhL","asin":"B002V0QPW4","title":"Children Playing Before a Statue of Hercules (Unabridged Selections)","authors":"Edited by David Sedaris","narrators":"David Sedaris, Mary-Louise Parker, Cherry Jones","length":"2 hrs and 54 mins"},{"cover":"61Ld10et-xL","asin":"B01MYV9WSI","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Lincoln in the Bardo","authors":"George Saunders","narrators":"Nick Offerman, David Sedaris, George Saunders, and others","length":"7 hrs and 25 mins"},{"cover":"61nIzk6CNdL","asin":"B013S5I6B8","title":"Lafayette in the Somewhat United States","authors":"Sarah Vowell","narrators":"Sarah Vowell, John Slattery, Nick Offerman, and others","length":"8 hrs and 7 mins"},{"cover":"51XQC4GlSoL","asin":"B002V0K2J6","subHeading":"The Indignities of Coach Class, The Torments of Low Thread Count, The Never- Ending Quest for Artisanal Olive Oil, and Other First World Problems","title":"Don't Get Too Comfortable (Unabridged Selections)","authors":"David Rakoff","narrators":"David Rakoff","length":"4 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"41bffUhJ4xL","asin":"0525633723","title":"A Promised Land","authors":"Barack Obama","narrators":"Barack Obama","length":"29 hrs and 10 mins"}],"added":29},{"asin":"B0036NHZ10","title":"The Eye of the World: Book One of The Wheel of Time","cover":"51Q5xbmQh1L","sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/aren/000370/bk_aren_000370_sample.mp3","series":[{"name":"Wheel of Time","asin":"/series","bookNumbers":["1"]}],"length":"29h 57m ","releaseDate":"2006-12-31","rating":4.6,"ratings":46916,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Jordan","url":"B000AQ19X6"}],"narrators":[{"name":"Kate Reading"},{"name":"Michael Kramer"}],"dateAdded":"2018-07-16","titleShort":"The Eye of the World","summary":"<p><b>\"These veteran narrators keep the plot moving and the narration fresh\" (</b><b><i>AudioFile Magazine</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>This program is read by Audie Award-winning narrators Michael Kramer and Kate Reading, and includes a bonus interview with the author.</b></p> <p><b>The Wheel of Time is a PBS Great American Read Selection!

Joining forces, these daring partners embark on a treacherous quest to find the source of the spirits' restlessness - a journey that will test their courage and trust and force them to stand against both enemies and friends to save their land before it's bathed in blood. </p>","publishers":[{"name":"HarperAudio"}],"categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Action & Adventure","url":"18574427011"}],"language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"615tntKUnGL","asin":"B071H9ZQVB","subHeading":"The Queens of Renthia, Book 2","title":"The Reluctant Queen","authors":"Sarah Beth Durst","narrators":"Khristine Hvam","length":"13 hrs and 47 mins"},{"cover":"510tzuszPtL","asin":"B07CNBWNJN","subHeading":"The Queens of Renthia, Book Three","title":"The Queen of Sorrow","authors":"Sarah Beth Durst","narrators":"Khristine Hvam","length":"15 hrs and 22 mins"},{"cover":"51VKk31z35L","asin":"0062897632","subHeading":"Tales of Renthia","title":"The Deepest Blue","authors":"Sarah Beth Durst","narrators":"Khristine Hvam","length":"12 hrs and 17 mins"},{"cover":"51GACZd3tyL","asin":"0062989391","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Race the Sands","authors":"Sarah Beth Durst","narrators":"Emily Ellet","length":"15 hrs and 45 mins"},{"cover":"51-Kz3gM9FL","asin":"B075KKRQPP","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The City of Brass","authors":"S.

If the king dies without a male heir, the country could be destroyed by civil war. Henry VIII wants to annul his marriage of twenty years, and marry Anne Boleyn. The pope and most of Europe opposes him. The quest for the king's freedom destroys his adviser, the brilliant Cardinal Wolsey, and leaves a power vacuum. Into this impasse steps Thomas Cromwell. Cromwell is a wholly original man, a charmer and a bully, both idealist and opportunist, astute in reading people and a demon of energy: he is also a consummate politician, hardened by his personal losses, implacable in his ambition. But Henry is volatile: one day tender, one day murderous. Cromwell helps him break the opposition, but what will be the price of his triumph? In inimitable style, Hilary Mantel presents a picture of a half-made society on the cusp of change, where individuals fight or embrace their fate with passion and courage.&nbsp;</p> <p>With a vast array of characters, overflowing with incident, the novel re-creates an era when the personal and political are separated by a hairbreadth, where success brings unlimited power but a single failure means death.&nbsp;</p>","publishers":[{"name":"Macmillan Audio"}],"categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Genre Fiction","url":"18574456011"}],"language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61U8knulv2L","asin":"B007WU26KI","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Bring Up the Bodies","authors":"Hilary Mantel","narrators":"Simon Vance","length":"14 hrs and 34 mins"},{"cover":"51OUAZT-WiL","asin":"1427289522","title":"The Mirror & the Light","authors":"Hilary Mantel","narrators":"Ben Miles","length":"38 hrs and 12 mins"},{"cover":"51uhMrSiJxL","asin":"B07HHG673V","subHeading":"A Revolutionary Life","title":"Thomas Cromwell","authors":"Diarmaid MacCulloch","narrators":"David Rintoul","length":"26 hrs and 38 mins"},{"cover":"41V1QiE1qhL","asin":"0593212142","title":"Hamnet","authors":"Maggie O'Farrell","narrators":"Ell Potter","length":"12 hrs and 42 mins"},{"cover":"51dYkLzpXvL","asin":"B002V8DHPY","title":"Restless","authors":"William Boyd","narrators":"Rosamund Pike","length":"10 hrs and 17 mins"},{"cover":"51Qsly9go6L","asin":"B06XP2VQL5","title":"Henry VIII: King and Court","authors":"Alison Weir","narrators":"Phyllida Nash","length":"25 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"51c5pqCsdVL","asin":"B01FY0EEAW","subHeading":"The Last of the Soviets","title":"Secondhand Time","authors":"Svetlana Alexievich, Bela Shayevich - translator","narrators":"Amanda Carlin, Mark Bramhall, Cassandra Campbell, and others","length":"22 hrs and 58 mins"},{"cover":"61EBok7MMlL","asin":"B00VMSY2OE","title":"The Architect's Apprentice","authors":"Elif Shafak","narrators":"Piter Marek","length":"16 hrs and 54 mins"},{"cover":"518jZDsPZxL","asin":"B00HCQCGJ8","title":"The Name of the Rose","authors":"Umberto Eco, William Weaver - translator","narrators":"Sean Barrett, Nicholas Rowe, Neville Jason","length":"21 hrs and 5 mins"},{"cover":"51RAa7zXelL","asin":"B002V02P9Q","title":"The Autobiography of Henry VIII","authors":"Margaret George","narrators":"David Case","length":"41 hrs and 18 mins"},{"cover":"61vDC3BToaL","asin":"B0084E101W","subHeading":"The Wars of the Roses","title":"Lancaster and York","authors":"Alison Weir","narrators":"Maggie Mash","length":"22 hrs and 9 mins"},{"cover":"51NJs+Rj6hL","asin":"0525637141","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Vanishing Half","authors":"Brit Bennett","narrators":"Shayna Small","length":"11 hrs and 34 mins"},{"cover":"61E1ARnMS1L","asin":"125031724X","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Four Winds","authors":"Kristin Hannah","narrators":"Julia Whelan","length":"15 hrs and 2 mins"},{"cover":"61Bc2QG+1XL","asin":"B009PRIE2K","title":"The Six Wives of Henry VIII","authors":"Alison Weir","narrators":"Simon Prebble","length":"22 hrs and 26 mins"},{"cover":"5172qPeZE+L","asin":"0063016753","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Last Boleyn","authors":"Karen Harper","narrators":"Melanie Crawley","length":"21 hrs and 4 mins"},{"cover":"51sZGDNO1RL","asin":"B01MTDK82J","title":"Austerlitz","authors":"W.

It is a vast and stirring work described as what the Bible might have been had it been written by God's daughters instead of sons. Far beyond the traditional women-of-the-Bible sagas in both impact and vigor, <i>The Red Tent </i>is based upon a mention in Genesis of Jacob's only female offspring - his daughter, Dinah.&nbsp;</p> <p>Author Anita Diamant, in the voice of Dinah, gives an insider's look at the details of women's lives in biblical times and a chronicle of their earthy stories and long-ignored histories. The red tent of the title is the place where women were sequestered during their cycles of birthing, menses, and illness. It is here that Dinah hears the whispered stories of her four mothers - Jacob's wives Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah - and tells their tales to us in remarkable and thought-provoking oratories.&nbsp;</p> <p>Familiar passages from the Bible take on new life as Dinah fills in what the Bible has left out - the lives of women. Dinah tells us of her initiation into the religious and sexual practices of the tribe; Jacob's courtship with Rachel and Leah; the ancient world of caravans, farmers, midwives, and slaves; her ill-fated sojourn in the city of Sechem; her years in Canaan; and her half-brother Joseph's rise in Egypt.</p> <p>Skillfully interweaving biblical tales with characters of her own invention, the author re-creates the life of Dinah providing an illuminating portrait of a courageous woman and the life she might have lived. A new view of the panorama of life in biblical times emerges from the female perspective, and the red tent itself becomes a symbol of womanly strength, love, and wisdom.</p> <p><i>The Red Tent</i> is one of those extremely rare publishing phenomenons - a little promoted, but dynamically successful book (over 250,000 copies sold) that owes its success to enthusiastic word-of-mouth endorsements. Now, for the first time, this sweeping saga, which has struck a chord with so many modern-day women, comes to life as a much-anticipated audiobook.&nbsp;</p>","publishers":[{"name":"Macmillan Audio"}],"categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Genre Fiction","url":"18574456011"}],"language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51s0SDrgxmL","asin":"B005MKCFVA","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Dovekeepers","authors":"Alice Hoffman, Heather Lind","narrators":"Aya Cash, Jessica Hecht, Tovah Feldshuh","length":"19 hrs and 1 min"},{"cover":"51gmEZQ0c1L","asin":"B00P6PJ1KE","title":"The Boston Girl: A Novel","authors":"Anita Diamant","narrators":"Linda Lavin","length":"7 hrs and 39 mins"},{"cover":"61ksAiF0m9L","asin":"1250222451","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Midnight at the Blackbird Cafe","authors":"Heather Webber","narrators":"Stephanie Willis, Bethany Lind, Nicholas Techosky","length":"11 hrs and 46 mins"},{"cover":"51fqMkzLzZL","asin":"B00SGNH7FY","subHeading":"A Royal Beauty","title":"Esther","authors":"Angela Hunt","narrators":"Rachel Botchan, Kevin R.
