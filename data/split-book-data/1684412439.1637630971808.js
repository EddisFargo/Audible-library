window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the slums of 18th-century France, the infant Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is born with one sublime gift - an absolute sense of smell. As a boy, he lives to decipher the odors of Paris and apprentices himself to a prominent perfumer who teaches him the ancient art of mixing precious oils and herbs.&nbsp;</p> <p>But Grenouille's genius is such that he is not satisfied to stop there, and he becomes obsessed with capturing the smells of objects such as brass doorknobs and fresh-cut wood. Then one day, he catches a hint of a scent that will drive him on an ever-more-terrifying quest to create the \"ultimate perfume\" - the scent of a beautiful young virgin. Told with dazzling narrative brilliance, <i>Perfume </i>is a hauntingly powerful tale of murder and sensual depravity.</p>";
