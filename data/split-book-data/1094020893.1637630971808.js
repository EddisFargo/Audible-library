window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A young lady's tarnished reputation might cost her everything in this first book in the Disreputable Debutantes series. </b></p> <p>Shy, bookish Sophie Brightwell is expected to make an advantageous match to improve her family's fortunes. However, Sophie's plans to make a spectacular debut go horribly awry when she and her three closest friends are expelled from a young ladies' academy for unbecoming conduct. Since the ton will be sure to close their doors on these disgraced debutantes, they determine that unconventional means need to be employed in the husband-hunting market. Rakehells - the beau monde's wickedest members - might be the only men willing to overlook a young lady's besmirched reputation.&nbsp;</p> <p>But how does one catch a rake?&nbsp;</p> <p>Nate Hastings, the devil-may-care Viscount Malverne, is the older brother of Sophie's best friend, fellow disgraced debutante Lady Charlotte. When a terribly foxed Nate accidentally compromises Sophie, Charlotte strikes a wicked bargain: in order to avoid a scandal and the parson's mousetrap, Nate must help Sophie snare a husband. But as Nate fulfills his obligation and begins to instruct the lovely Sophie in the art of luring rakes, he soon finds himself battling his own fierce attraction to her.</p>";
