window.bookSummaryJSON = "Charlaine Harris' popular Southern Vampire mysteries have been described by <i>Publishers Weekly</i> as \"humorous Southern-fried fantasy\" with a little bit of romance. <p> In the follow up to Dead Until Dark, telepathic friend of the undead (and vampire bar cocktail waitress) Sookie Stackhouse puts her newfound powers to the test. After an unfortunate incident, Sookie finds herself beholden to a group of Louisiana vampires. So she agrees to travel to Dallas with her undead boyfriend Bill and track down a missing vamp, but only if the vampires promise to let local humans go unharmed. That seems easier said than done when an upstart religious cult threatens to destroy all things vampire - including Sookie, who is quickly scheduled for sacrifice.</p>";
