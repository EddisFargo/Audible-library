Nor would anyone guess that she's responsible for dozens of the best forgeries in London's antiquities markets. But if her love for Alex is doomed to fail, she must raise enough money to escape the marriage mart. She just needs one last daring forgery to set herself up for life.... </p><p><b>A man evading disaster...</b> </p><p>Alex Staunton, the rich earl of Salford, lives a charmed existence. No one knows that he's dangerously attracted to his sister's best friend. Nor has he revealed that he suffers from an ancient curse - one that has given him everything but prevents him from marrying the woman of his dreams. But when an enemy from his past takes an unseemly interest in Prudence's future, Alex must find a way to break the curse...or risk losing her forever. </p><p><b>A love they're destined for...</b> </p><p>Every seductive encounter brings them closer together - but their secret smoldering desires will inevitably burn them. And when Prudence's illicit forgery collides with Alex's desperate search, more than their hearts are at stake. Can they break Alex's curse and save Prudence from her unwanted suitor? Or will their love become a weapon that will destroy them both? </p>";
