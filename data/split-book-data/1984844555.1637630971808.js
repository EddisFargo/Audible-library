window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Fifth in the legendary Lymond Chronicles, <i>The Ringed Castle </i>leaps from Mary Tudor's England to the barbaric Russia of Ivan the Terrible. Francis Crawford of Lymond moves to Muscovy, where he becomes adviser and general to the half-mad tsar. Yet even as Lymond tries to civilize a court that is still frozen in the attitudes of the Middle Ages, forces in England conspire to enlist this infinitely useful man in their own schemes.</p>";
