window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;best-selling author of&nbsp;<i>Rules of Civility</i>, a&nbsp;novel about a man who is ordered to spend the rest of his life inside a luxury hotel — a beautifully transporting novel.&nbsp;</p> <p>The mega best seller with more than two million listeners, soon to be a major television series</p> <p>“Perhaps the&nbsp;ultimate&nbsp;quarantine read . . .&nbsp;<i>A Gentleman in Moscow</i>&nbsp;is about&nbsp;the importance of community; the distance of a kind act; and resilience. It's a manual for getting through the days to come.” (<i>O, The Oprah Magazine</i>)</p> <p>In 1922, Count Alexander Rostov is deemed an unrepentant aristocrat by a Bolshevik tribunal, and is sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol, a grand hotel across the street from the Kremlin. Rostov, an indomitable man of erudition and wit, has never worked a day in his life, and must now live in an attic room while some of the most tumultuous decades in Russian history are unfolding outside the hotel’s doors. Unexpectedly, his reduced circumstances provide him entry into a much larger world of emotional discovery.&nbsp;</p> <p>Brimming with humor, a glittering cast of characters, and one beautifully rendered scene after another, this singular novel casts a spell as it relates the count’s endeavor to gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be a man of purpose.</p>";
