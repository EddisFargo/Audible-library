She believed she knew every horror, and was beyond surprise. She was wrong.</i></p> <p>In the wake of tragedy, neither Lazlo nor Sarai are who they were before. One a god, the other a ghost, they struggle to grasp the new boundaries of their selves as dark-minded Minya holds them hostage, intent on vengeance against Weep.</p> <p>Lazlo faces an unthinkable choice - save the woman he loves, or <i>everyone else</i>? - while Sarai feels more helpless than ever.
