The authors of the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling </b><b><i>My Lady Jane</i></b><b> are back with an irreverent spin on </b><b><i>Jane Eyre - </i></b><b>a tale of mischief, romance, and supernatural mayhem perfect for fans of </b><b><i>The Princess Bride</i></b><b> or </b><b><i>A Gentleman’s Guide to Vice and Virtue.</i></b></p> <p>You may think you know the story. Penniless orphan Jane Eyre begins a new life as a governess at Thornfield Hall, where she meets one dark, brooding Mr. Rochester - and, listener, she marries him. Or does she?</p> <p>Prepare for an adventure of Gothic proportions in this standalone follow-up to <i>My Lady Jane</i>, which was called “an utter delight” (ALA <i>Booklist</i>, starred review), and “an uproarious historical fantasy that’s not to be missed” (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review).</p>";
