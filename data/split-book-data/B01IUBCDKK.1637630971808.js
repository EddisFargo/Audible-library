window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The best-selling author of <i>Girl Waits with Gun</i> returns with another adventure featuring the fascinating, feisty, and unforgettable Kopp sisters. </p> <p>After besting (and arresting) a ruthless silk factory owner and his gang of thugs in <i>Girl Waits with Gun</i>, Constance Kopp became one of the nation's first deputy sheriffs. She's proven that she can't be deterred, evaded, or outrun. But when the wiles of a German-speaking con man threaten her position and her hopes for this new life and endanger the honorable Sheriff Heath, Constance may not be able to make things right. </p> <p><i>Lady Cop Makes Trouble</i> sets Constance loose on the streets of New York City and New Jersey - tracking down victims, trailing leads, and making friends with girl reporters and lawyers at a hotel for women. Cheering her on, and goading her, are her sisters, Norma and Fleurette - that is, when they aren't training pigeons for the war effort or fanning dreams of a life on the stage. </p> <p>Based on a true story, <i>Girl Waits with Gun</i> introduced Constance Kopp and her charming and steadfast sisters to an army of enthusiastic listeners. Those listeners will be thrilled by this second installment - also ripped from the headlines - in the romping, wildly listenable life of a woman forging her own path, tackling crime and nefarious criminals along the way. </p>";
