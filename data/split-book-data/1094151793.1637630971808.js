window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In Scotland, where thrift and a \"nice set of dentures\" are generally admired, dental surgeon Dr. Frederick Gilchrist’s cheap rates and penchant for pulling teeth have gained him a clientele.</p> <p>However, wiser Highlanders (like Hamish Macbeth) opt to steer clear of this reputed womanizer’s all-too-busy hands. A blinding toothache sends Hamish Macbeth 120 miles out of Lochdubh to the infamous dentist’s door. Unfortunately for Hamish and Gilchrist, someone has canceled all the doctor’s appointments - permanently. Since everyone is pleased the dentist is deceased - patients, several harassed women, and even his wife - Macbeth faces one of the more biting challenges of his career.</p> <p>A toothache can drive a man mad, and Hamish, with a mouth full of throbbing pain, decides to go after the killer alone.</p>";
