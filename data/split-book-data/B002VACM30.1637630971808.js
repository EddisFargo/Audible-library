window.bookSummaryJSON = "All the zany Wodehouse characters are here: Bertie, Gussie Fink-Nottle, Madeline Bassett, and Aunt Dahlia. All the humorous chaos of misunderstandings, puns, and pranks are present: someone must hand out prizes at the Market Snodsbury Grammar School, a lovers' spat finds Bertie engaged to Madeline, and a hunger strike causes the cook to give notice. The inevitable rescue by Jeeves, brilliantly conceived and executed, averts disaster and saves nitwit Bertie Wooster. <p>Acclaimed actor Jonathan Cecil brings comic flair to this rollicking tale by the man <i>The Times</i> (London) called \"a brilliantly funny writer\".</p>";
