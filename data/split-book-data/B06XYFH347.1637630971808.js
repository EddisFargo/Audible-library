window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Discover and rediscover the world of the Queen's Thief, from the acclaimed series launch&nbsp;The Thief to the thrilling, 20-years-in-the-making conclusion,&nbsp;</b><b><i>The Return of the Thief</i></b><b>. </b></p> <p><i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Megan Whalen Turner's entrancing and award-winning Queen's Thief novels bring to life the world of the epics and feature one of the most charismatic and incorrigible characters of fiction, Eugenides the thief. Megan Whalen Turner's Queen's Thief novels are rich with political machinations and intrigue, battles lost and won, dangerous journeys, divine intervention, power, passion, revenge, and deception. Perfect for fans of Leigh Bardugo, Marie Lu, Patrick Rothfuss, and George R. R. Martin.&nbsp;</p> <p>Eugenides, no stranger to desperate circumstances, has gotten himself into difficulties he can't get out of. Used to being treated with a certain measure of wariness, if not respect, he suffers the pranks, insults, and intrigue of the Attolian court with dwindling patience. As usual, nothing is as it appears when he rescues a hot-headed young soldier in the Palace Guard. The Queen's Thief novels have been praised by writers, critics, reviewers, and fans and have been honored with glowing reviews, \"best of\" citations, and numerous awards, including the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize, a Newbery Honor, the Andre Norton Award shortlist, and the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award.</p>";
