window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The comical, fantastical, romantical, (not) entirely true story of Lady Jane Grey. </p> <p>In <i>My Lady Jane</i>, coauthors Cynthia Hand, Brodi Ashton, and Jodi Meadows have created a one-of-a-kind fantasy in the tradition of <i>The Princess Bride</i>, featuring a reluctant king, an even more reluctant queen, a noble steed, and only a passing resemblance to actual history - because sometimes history needs a little help. </p> <p>At 16, Lady Jane Grey is about to be married off to a stranger and caught up in a conspiracy to rob her cousin, King Edward, of his throne. But those trifling problems aren't for Jane to worry about. <i>Jane</i> gets to be queen of England. </p> <p>Like that could go wrong. </p>";
