window.bookSummaryJSON = "This hilarious installment of the inimitable manservant Jeeves and his twit of an employer, Bertie Wooster, is one of the best stories written by the master of the pen, prank, and pun. When Bertie Wooster goes to stay with his Aunt Dahlia at Brinkley Court and finds himself engaged to the imperious Lady Florence Craye, disaster threatens from all sides. <p> While Florence tries to cultivate his mind, her former fianc√©, hefty ex-policeman Stilton Cheesewright, threatens to beat his body to a pulp, and her new admirer, the bleating poet Percy Gorringe, tries to borrow a thousand pounds. To cap it all, there's a jewelry heist and Bertie has incurred the disapproval of Jeeves by growing a moustache. All in all, a classic Wodehouse farce.</p>";
